DebateSynergy.com source code is open and free for improvements from the high school and college debate community, so that users can make custom plugins and suggest feature improvements under the Issues tab. Built with Node.js and MongoDB, using CRUD requests to store user's files for online research in db and socket.io to livestream debate rounds, as the user scrolls speech, to the room of opposing debaters.

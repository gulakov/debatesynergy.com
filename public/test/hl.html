<p><b><u><br></u></b></p><p><b><u>Plan first</u>—can't judge ethics without looking to policy&nbsp;</b><span><b>consequences</b></span><br></p><p><b><span>Gvos</span>dev 5</b><span>&nbsp;– executive editor of The National Interest</span><u>&nbsp;</u><span>(Nikolas, The Value(s) of Realism, SAIS Review 25.1, pmuse, AG)</span></p><p><span><span><br></span></span></p><p><span>As<span>&nbsp;the&nbsp;</span>name impli<span>es, realists focus on promoting policies that are achievable and sustainable. In turn,&nbsp;</span></span><u>the&nbsp;morality&nbsp;of&nbsp;a</u><span>&nbsp;foreign&nbsp;</span><u>policy</u><span>&nbsp;action&nbsp;</span><u>is judged by&nbsp;its&nbsp;results, not</u><span>&nbsp;by the&nbsp;</span><u>intentions</u><span>&nbsp;of its framers.&nbsp;</span><u>A</u><span>&nbsp;foreign&nbsp;</span><u>policymaker must weigh&nbsp;the&nbsp;consequences&nbsp;of any</u><span>&nbsp;course of&nbsp;</span><u><span>action and assess the resources</span><span> at hand</span></u><span>&nbsp;to carry out the proposed task. As Lippmann warned, Without the controlling principle that the n</span><span>ation must maintain its objectives and its power in equilibrium, its purposes within its means and its means equal to its purposes, its commitments related to its resources and its resources adequate to its commitments, it is impossible to&nbsp;think at all about foreign affairs.8 Commenting on this maxim, Owen Harries, founding editor of The National Interest, noted, "This is a truth of which Americans—more apt to focus on ends rather than means when it comes to dealing with the rest of the world—need always to be reminded."9 In fact, Morgenthau noted that "there can be no political morality without prudence."10 This virtue of pr</span></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><span><span>udence—which Morgenthau identified as the cornerstone of realism—should not be confused with expediency. Rather, it takes as its starting point that&nbsp;</span><u>it is more moral</u><span>&nbsp;to fulfill one's commitments than to make "empty" promises, and&nbsp;</span><u>to seek solutions&nbsp;that minimize harm and pr oduce sustainable results</u><span><span>. Morgenthau concluded: [End Page 18] Political realism does not require, nor does it condone, indifference to political ideals and moral principles, but&nbsp;</span><u>it requires</u></span><span>&nbsp;indeed a sharp&nbsp;</span><u>distinction between the desirable and</u><span>&nbsp;the possible, between what is desirable everywhere and at all times and&nbsp;</span><u>what is possible under the concrete circumstances of time and place</u><span>.11 This is why, prior to the outbreak of fighting in the former Yugoslavia, U.S. and European realists urged that Bosnia be decentralized and partitioned into ethnically based cantons as a way to head off a destructive civil war. Realists felt this would be the best course of action, especially after the country's first free and fair elections had brought nationalist candidates to power at the expense of those calling for inter-ethnic cooperation. They had concluded—correctly, as it turned out—that the United States and Western Europe would be unwilling to invest the blood and treasure that would be required to craft a unitary Bosnian state and give it the wherewithal to function. Indeed, at a diplomatic conference in Lisbon in March 1992, the various factions in Bosnia had, reluctantly, endorsed the broad outlines of such a settlement. For the purveyors of moralpolitik, this was unacceptable. After all, for this plan to work, populations on the "wrong side" of the line would have to be transferred and resettled. Such a plan struck directly at the heart of the concept of multi-ethnicity—that different ethnic and religious groups could find a common political identity and work in common institutions. When the United States signaled it would not accept such a settlement, the fragile consensus collapsed. The United States, of course, cannot be held responsible for the </span><span>war; this lies squarely on the shoulders of Bosnia's political leaders. Yet Washington fell victim to what Jonathan Clarke called "faux Wilsonianism,"&nbsp;</span><u>the&nbsp;belief that&nbsp;"high-flown&nbsp;words matter more than rational calculation" in formulating</u><span><span>&nbsp;effective&nbsp;</span><u>policy</u></span><span>, which&nbsp;</span><u>led U.S</u><span>. policymakers</span><span>&nbsp;</span><u>to dispense with</u><span>&nbsp;the equation of "</span><u>balancing&nbsp;commitments&nbsp;and&nbsp;resources</u><span>."12 Indeed, as he notes,&nbsp;the&nbsp;</span><span><u>Clinton</u><span>&nbsp;administration had&nbsp;</span></span><u>criticized peace&nbsp;plans&nbsp;calling for</u><span>&nbsp;decentralized&nbsp;</span><u>partition&nbsp;in Bosnia "with lofty rhetoric without&nbsp;proposing&nbsp;a practical alternative." The subsequent war led to the deaths of</u><span><span>&nbsp;tens of&nbsp;</span><u>thousands</u></span><span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;left more than a million people homeless. After three years of war, the Dayton Accords—hailed as a triumph of American diplomacy—created a complicated arrangement by which the federal union of two ethnic units, the Muslim-Croat Federation, was itself federated to a Bosnian Serb re</span><span>public. Today, Bosnia requires thousands of foreign troops to patrol its internal borders and billions of dollars in foreign aid to keep its government and economy functioning. Was the aim of U.S. policymakers, academics and journalists—creating a multi-ethnic democracy in Bosnia—not worth pursuing? No, not at all, and this is not what the argument suggests. But aspirations were not matched with capabilities.&nbsp;</span><u>As a result of&nbsp;holding out for the "most moral" outcome</u><span>&nbsp;and encouraging</span><span> the Muslim-led government in Sarajevo to pursue maximalist aims&nbsp;</span><u>rather than&nbsp;finding a workable&nbsp;compromise that could have avoided bloodshed</u><span>&nbsp;and produced more stable conditions,&nbsp;the&nbsp;peoples of&nbsp;</span><u>Bosnia suffered greatly</u><span>. In&nbsp;the end,&nbsp;</span><span><u>the final settlement was very close</u><span>&nbsp;[End Page 19]&nbsp;</span><u>to the one</u><span>&nbsp;that realists had&nbsp;</span></span><u>initially&nbsp;proposed—and</u><span>&nbsp;</span><u>t</u><span>he one that had also been roundly&nbsp;</span><u>condemned&nbsp;on moral grounds.</u></span></p><u><u><br></u></u><p><b>Perm- do plan and non-mutually-exclusive alternative</b></p><p><b><br>Working with state good</b></p><p><b>Lobel 7</b><span>&nbsp;</span>– Professor of Law, San Diego&nbsp;<span>(Orly, The Paradox Of Extralegal Activism, , AG)</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span><span>In the following sections, I argue that the extralegal model has suffered from the same drawbacks associated with legal cooptation. I show that&nbsp;</span><u>as an effort to avoid</u><span>&nbsp;the risk of legal&nbsp;</span><u>cooptation</u><span>, the current wave of suggested&nbsp;</span><u>alternatives</u><span>&nbsp;has effects that&nbsp;</span><u>ironically mirror those of cooptation itself</u><span>. Three central types of difficulties exist with con- temporary extralegal scholarship. First, in the contexts of the labor and civil rights movements, arguments about legal cooptation often developed in response to a perceived gap between the conceptual ideal toward which a social reform group struggled and its actual accomplishments. But, ironically, the contemporary message of&nbsp;</span><u>opting out of traditional</u><span>&nbsp;legal&nbsp;</span><u>reform&nbsp;avenues</u><span>&nbsp;may&nbsp;</span><u>only accentuate this problem</u><span>. As the rise of informalization (moving to nonlegal strategies), civil society (moving to extralegal spheres), and pluralism (the proliferation of norm-generating actors) has been effected and appropriated by supporters from a wide range of political commitments, these concepts have had unintended implications that conflict with the very social reform ideals from which they stem. Second, the idea of&nbsp;</span><u>opting out of the legal arena&nbsp;becomes self-defeating as it discounts&nbsp;the ongoing importance of</u><span>&nbsp;law and the possibilities of&nbsp;</span><u>legal reform</u><span>&nbsp;in seemingly unregulated spheres. A model encompassing exit&nbsp;</span><u>and</u><span>&nbsp;rigid sphere distinctions further&nbsp;</span><u>fails to recognize a reality of increasing</u><span>&nbsp;interpenetration and&nbsp;the&nbsp;</span><u>blurring of boundaries between</u><span>&nbsp;private and public spheres, profit and nonprofit sectors, and&nbsp;</span><u>formal and informal institutions</u><span>. It therefore loses the critical insight that&nbsp;</span><u>law operates in the background of seemingly unregulated relationships</u><span>. Again paradoxically, the extralegal view of&nbsp;</span><u>decentralized activism and the&nbsp;division of society into different spheres</u><span>&nbsp;in fact have worked to&nbsp;</span><u>subvert</u><span>&nbsp;rather than support&nbsp;</span><u>the progressive agenda</u><span>. Finally,&nbsp;</span><u>since&nbsp;extralegal actors view their actions with</u><span>&nbsp;romantic&nbsp;</span><u>idealism, they fail to develop tools for evaluating their success</u><span>. If the critique of legal cooptation has involved the argument that legal reform, even when viewed as a victory, is never radically transformative, we must ask:&nbsp;</span><u>what are the criteria for assessing&nbsp;the achievements of the</u><span>&nbsp;suggested&nbsp;</span><u>alternatives</u><span>? As I illustrate in the following sections, much of the current scholarship obscures the lines between the descriptive and the prescriptive in its formulation of social activism. If current suggestions present themselves as alternatives to formal legal struggles,&nbsp;</span><u>we must question whether the new extralegal politics</u><span>&nbsp;that are proposed and celebrated&nbsp;</span><u>are capable of producing</u><span>&nbsp;a constructive theory and&nbsp;</span><u>meaningful</u><span>&nbsp;channels for&nbsp;</span><u>reform, rather than passive status quo politics.</u></span></p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<h1>State Good—ext</h1>

<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p><b>Reinforcing the state is strategic—your alternative will either get
violently crushed or cause private tyranny</b></p>

<p><span><b>Chomsky 98</b> – Prof Linguistics, MIT <span>(Noam,
The Common Good, p 84-5, AG)</span></span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span><span>So Argentina is "minimizing the state"—cutting down public
expenditures, the way our government is doing, but much more extremely. Of
course, </span><u>when you minimize the state, you maximize</u><span> something else—and it isn't popular control. What gets
maximized is private power, domestic and foreign. I met with a very lively
anarchist movement in Buenos Aires, and with other anarchist groups as far away
as northeast Brazil, where nobody even knew they existed. We had a lot of
discussions about these matters. They recognize that they have to try to use
the state—even though they regard it as totally illegitimate. The reason is
perfectly obvious: When you eliminate the one institutional structure in which
people can participate to some extent—namely the government—you're simply
handing over power to unaccountable </span><u>private tyrannies that are much
worse. So you have to</u><span> make </span><u>use</u><span> of </span><u>the state, all the time recognizing that
you ultimately want to eliminate it</u><span>. Some of
the rural workers in Brazil have an interesting slogan. They say their
immediate task is "expanding the floor of the cage." They understand
that they're trapped inside a cage, but realize that </span><u>protecting it
when it's under attack</u><span> from even worse
predators on the outside, </span><u>and extending the limits of what the cage
will allow, are</u><span> both </span><u>essential
preliminaries to dismantling it. If they attack the cage directly</u><span> when they're so vulnerable, </span><u>they'll get
murdered</u><span>. That's something anyone ought to be
able to understand who can keep two ideas in their head at once, but some
people here in the US tend to be so rigid and doctrinaire that they don't
understand the point. But </span><u>unless the left</u><span> here </span><u>is willing to tolerate that</u><span> level of </span><u>complexity, we're not going to be of any use to
people who are suffering</u><span> and need our help—</span><u><span>or</span></u><span>,
for that matter, </span><u><span>to ourselves</span></u><span>. </span></span></p>
